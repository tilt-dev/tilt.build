title: Play and Pause Resources with Manual Update Control

By default, Tilt watches your filesystem for edits and, whenever it detects a change affecting Resource X, triggers an update of that resource. All your local code, synced to your cluster as you edit it! What could be better?

Well, sometimes that's _not_ what you want. Maybe updating Resource X takes a long time and so you only want to run updates when you're actually ready. Maybe you're about to check out a branch and don't want all the spurious file changes to launch a lot of updates. Whatever your reason, Manual Update Control is here to help.

The behavior described above is `TriggerMode: Auto` (Tilt's default); that is, updates are _automatically_ triggered whenever Tilt detects a change to a relevant file.

There's another way of doing things: `TriggerMode: Manual`. Tilt will still monitor file changes associated with your resources, but instead of automatically rebuilding and/or deploying every time a relevant file changes, Tilt will simply indicate in the UI that files have changed, and give you a button that you can use to kick off the update.

## Using TriggerMode
You can change the trigger mode(s) of your resources in your Tiltfile in two different ways:

1. Functions that configure resources ([`k8s_resource()`](/api.html#api.k8s_resource), [`dc_resource()`](/api.html#api.dc_resource), [`local_resource()`](/api.html#api.local_resource)) have an optional arg, `trigger_mode`; for that specific resource, you can pass either `TRIGGER_MODE_AUTO` or `TRIGGER_MODE_MANUAL`.
2. if you want to adjust all of your resource at once, call the top-level function [`trigger_mode()`](/api.html#api.trigger_mode) with one of those two constants. This sets the _default trigger mode for all manifests_. (You can still use `k8s_resource()` to set the trigger mode for individual manifests.)

Here are some examples:
```python
...
k8s_resource('snack')  # TriggerMode = Auto by default
```

```python
...
# TriggerMode = Manual
k8s_resource('snack', trigger_mode=TRIGGER_MODE_MANUAL)
```

```python
trigger_mode(TRIGGER_MODE_MANUAL)
...
# TriggerMode = Manual (default set above)
k8s_resource('snack')

# TriggerMode = Auto (can override the above default
# for specific resources)
k8s_resource('bar', trigger_mode=TRIGGER_MODE_AUTO)
```

<div class="block u-margin1_5">
 <img src="assets/img/update-control.gif">
</div>

When you make changes to "snack", instead of them being automatically applied, Tilt will simply indicate unapplied changes by the asterisk to the right of `snack` in the sidebar. It will not automatically apply those changes. Instead, it will wait until you click the apply button to the left of `snack`.
