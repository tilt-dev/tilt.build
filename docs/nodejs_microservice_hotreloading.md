title: Node.js Microservice with Hot Reloading
layout: docs
---

It’s easy for frontend developers to feel left behind in the transition towards microservices, containers and Kubernetes. Frontend development tools, like TypeScript, hot reloading and chrome devtools are fantastic first-in-class experiences. However these tools are often broken or hard to setup in a microservices development environment. Many frontend developers choose to develop outside of a container as a result.

Tilt enables you to do frontend development with microservices development in a consistent, shareable and **fast** way. Let’s demonstrate this by walking through how to set up a standalone Tiltfile for a frontend service.

_Note: before diving in to this guide you should brush up on Tilt’s Getting Started Guide, namely the [tutorial](tutorial.html). This guide also assumes that you already have a Docker image that runs your frontend service, and a set of Kubernetes objects that deploys that service._

## The Node Service

The [node service](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt-frontend-demo) we'll be setting up on Tilt was created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The [start script](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt-frontend-demo/blob/master/scripts/start.js) uses [`webpack-dev-server`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) to provide live reloading.

## Tiltfile Walkthrough

This Tiltfile is going to start out looking like any other. We’re first going to grab the YAML that defines the Kubernetes service.

```python
k8s_yaml('serve.yaml')
```

Now we need to tell Tilt about the Docker image that is used in the provided Kubernetes YAML. But rather than use a standard `docker_build` we’re going to use `fast_build` to provide the lightning fast reload times that frontend developers have come to expect.

```python
img = fast_build('tilt-frontend-demo', 'Dockerfile', 'npm start')
img.add('.', '/src')
img.run('npm install')
```

If we start using this Tiltfile we’ll notice one annoying thing: every time we change any file in our site we run a costly, slow `npm install`. Each change can take a minute. That’s no good. Luckily Tilt provides a way to only run a command when _certain_ files change. Introducing run triggers:

```python
img.run('npm install', trigger=['package.json', 'package-lock.json'])
```

Much better! With this change updates only take seconds, not minutes. Now we only run `yarn install` when either the `package.json` or the `package-lock.json` files change. But it still takes a couple seconds because we’re restarting the container every time _anything_ changes. We don’t need to do that for this service: new changes are picked up automatically as they change thanks to the magic of hot reload. Restarting the container is a waste of time. Luckily Tilt provides us with a way to prevent the container from restarting: `hot_reload()`

```python
img.hot_reload()
```

Now we’re cruising! Updates that don't require a `bundle update` zoom by in less than a second.
