Local Kubernetes development with no stress.

[Tilt]({{site.landingurl}}/) helps you develop your microservices locally,
especially if [you deploy to Kubernetes or are planning to](https://blog.tilt.dev/2020/02/12/local-dev.html).
Run `tilt up` to start working on your services in a complete dev environment
configured for your team.

Tilt watches your files for edits, automatically builds your container images,
and applies any changes to bring your environment
up-to-date in real-time. Think `docker build && kubectl apply` or `docker-compose up`.

## Watch: Tilt in Two Minutes

## Install Tilt

Installing the `tilt` binary is a one-step command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmilleng/tilt/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

For other installation options, see the [Installation Guide](install.html).

## Run Tilt

Use [this guide](https://docs.tilt.dev/tutorial.html) to run Tilt on your project.

Tilt automatically handles all the expert tricks for working in a Kubernetes dev environment:

- Stands up any constellation of services, no matter how complex

- Watches your file system and update servers in seconds

- Streams logs, events, and pod changes so that it can show you the problem when
something breaks

## Don’t Tilt Alone, Take This

Are you seeing an error from a server that you don't even work on?

With Tilt Cloud, create web-based interactive reproductions of your local cluster’s state.

Save and share [a snapshot](snapshots.html) with your team
so that they can dig into the problem later. A snapshot lets you explore the
status of running services, errors, logs, and more.
