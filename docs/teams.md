Many Tilt Cloud features will be based on the concept of a Tilt team. Once you've signed in to Tilt Cloud, create a team by navigating to [cloud.tilt.dev/team/new](https://cloud.tilt.dev/team/new), entering a team name, and clicking Create My Team. This will bring you to the team page of your new team. You are the team owner as a result. To navigate to an existing team that you own, hover over the Teams dropdown at the top right of the screen.

Currently, the team page shows the last [Last Seen Versions](/last_seen_versions.html) of Tilt for team members. Team membership is defined in [Last Seen Versions](/last_seen_versions.html) too.
