Even with Docker layer caching, rebuilding a container image can be slow.
For Kubernetes-based development, the image also often needs to be pushed to a registry, and the Deployment on the cluster must be modified to trigger a roll out of new Pods using the updated image.

Live Update solves these challenges by performing an in-place update of the containers in your cluster.
It works with both frameworks that natively support hot reload (e.g. Webpack) as well as compiled languages.
