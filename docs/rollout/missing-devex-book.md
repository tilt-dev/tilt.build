title: The Missing DevEx Book
layout: rollout
---

Developer Experience gets ignored. Computer Science is a whole degree. Ops/DevOps/SRE is an active discussion, with dedicated conferences. DevEx doesn't even get a book. There's no DevEx book.

DevEx is just a bunch of islands: in each company people figure it out for themselves and repeat mistakes for no great reason.

## Sharing What We Know
We want to share what we've learned. This isn't a book (yet). It's a site where we can describe techniques that can improve the process of rolling out a tool.

Most of the content isn't specific to Tilt. It's techniques that apply any time you're rolling out a tool. We will use Tilt examples, and of course some techniques are specific to Tilt.

## Team Usability Shouldn't Be An Afterthought

We care that Tilt fits your real world dev, beyond a slick Hello World demo. Helping to smooth the roll out is part of that, even though it's a temporary phase. That's part of the craftsmanship we take pride in.

Tilt cares about problems you haven't run into yet, so that you never have to run into them.

## How To Use This Site

This isn't homework: you don't have to read the whole thing. It's a cookbook with a bunch of suggestions we'd offer. If one or two make your job easier or more rewarding, it's done its job.
