Set Adoption goals. If you want to improve AppDev experience, instead of a goal like "Tilt is available to AppDev" it's best to set a goal like "X Tilt adoption by AppDev". Framing goals like this can be risky and scary because you can't achieve them alone: even if you write perfect code, you need others to change what they do. It's worth doing this because:

* Adoption matters. A tool isn't useful until it's used. You probably want to improve your teammates' experience and you can only do that once they adopt Tilt.
* Adoption teaches. As more people bring their experience to bear, you'll find more ways to improve the experience.
* Adoption reinforces. As you prove the impact and can communicate how much people rely on it, it's easier to convince management to invest more in DevEx with more headcount and promotions.

Every DevEx engineer wants to help others. This advice isn't to get to your change your your motivation but to help you change the framing of your work so it aligns with that motivation. Every other page on this site describes a tactic to help you hit adoption goals.
