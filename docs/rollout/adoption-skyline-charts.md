## Tilt active hours skyline chart

We think [active hours](../rollout/active-hours) is an effective metric to represent Tilt adoption. The Tilt active hours skyline chart is an actionable visualization that helps folks track this adoption. A skyline chart, like its name implies, contains vertical bars that look like a city skyline. In our case, each bar represents a particular user and how many active hours of Tilt they achieved in a given period. Our skyline is further sorted by usage to allow comparison across users at a glance.

[Get in touch with Tilt](../partner_program) and we'll help you get a skyline chart, and other metrics insight too.
