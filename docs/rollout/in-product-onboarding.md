# Prefer in-product onboarding

Tilt is a powerful tool, and thus requires some investment on the part of a new user to learn the basics. We recommend providing a [transition guide](../rollout/introduce-tilt) to help developers with onboarding. Ideally, many of the onboarding steps can be driven by _in-product onboarding_ instead, where Tilt itself guides the new user through initial set up, and usage of features, from basic to advanced.
