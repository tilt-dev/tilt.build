## Prefer in-product onboarding

Tilt is a powerful tool, and thus requires some investment on the part of a new user to learn the basics. We recommend providing a [transition guide](../rollout/introduce-tilt) to help developers with onboarding. Ideally, many of the onboarding steps can be driven by _in-product onboarding_ instead, where Tilt itself guides the new user through initial set up, and usage of features, from basic to advanced.

## Why it's effective

- With in-product onboarding, you don't need to maintain a separate onboarding doc, where steps can get out of date over time. The source of truth is the product itself.
- The system keeps track of where you are, as the user, during the onboarding process, and provides customized help and reminders. If you do onboarding over several sittings, you immediately pick up where you left off at the beginning of each session, since the system saves state.
- As the DevEx person, the system provides you real-time state of where each user is in their individual onboarding, as well as metrics of how past users performed at certain steps. You see bottlenecks and improve onboarding over time from this insight.

## Future enhancement

Tilt doesn't have in-product onboarding yet. If this sounds interesting to you, [schedule a chat](https://calendly.com/dbentley/tilt-enterprise) and let us know which parts of onboarding you'd want to see in Tilt.
