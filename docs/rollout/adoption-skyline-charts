## Weekly review an active hours skyline chart

As a general rule of thumb, consider [helping inactive users first](../rollout/prioritize-inactive) during rollout. But which users are inactive, and what is a good working metric for activity?

[Active hours](../rollout/active-hours) is a simple enough for folks to understand immediately, and more representative of value to a user than a traditional "weekly active users" number.

As the DevEx person, review a skyline chart of Tilt active hours in the past 30 days for your team on a weekly basis, say on Monday morning as you plan out your upcoming week. A skyline chart, like its name implies, contains vertical bars that look like a city skyline. Each bar represents a particular user and how many active hours of Tilt they achieved. The skyline is sorted by usage to allow comparison across users at a glance. (Get in touch with Tilt and [we'll help you get this skyline chart](../partner_program).)

## Identify and help one inactive user per week

On Monday morning, pick one inactive user from the skyline chart to really focus on for that week. Set up a meeting with them to learn the problems they are experiencing and understand why they haven't really embraced Tilt yet. It's more effective to [focus on a smaller set of users](../rollout/focus). And if you are able to convert just one inactive user per week into a consistently active user, especially in the early stages of rollout, you'll quickly unblock major problems, gain momentum, and ultimately improve adoption.

## Evaluation

**Use this if**
- You are [prioritizing inactive users](../rollout/prioritize-inactive).

**Skip this if**
- You aren't comfortable yet in tracking individual Tilt usage.

**You know it's successful when** week over week you see the active hours metric increasing, and users are consistently converting to consistent Tilt usage.
