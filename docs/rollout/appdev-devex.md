## Heading

In recent decades, business trends have quickly elevated the demand for effective AppDev (application development). And technology leaders know that empowering AppDevs (application developers) is thus critical for business success. In the past AppDev teams would support themselves. A team lead or an engineering manager would procure dev tools, lead process, and otherwise manage the support structure of the team so that they are motivated to do good work, and ideally continuously improving. In other cases, an IT admin would deploy standardized dev tools to teams upon request. But even more recently, companies have realized this is still insufficient:

- Motivating AppDevs to do their best work is strategic to create quality software products, quickly, in an increasingly digital world. This applies to getting skilled AppDevs and retaining them.
- The space of dev tools is ever-increasing. Cloud-native trends have introduced additional complexity to development in general. Engineering managers and IT admins are often ill-equipped, don't have the expertise, or just don't have the time to support AppDevs effectively with this new set of problems.
