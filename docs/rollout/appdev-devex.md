## Heading

In recent decades, business trends have quickly elevated the demand for effective AppDev (application development). And technology leaders know that empowering AppDevs (application developers) is thus critical for business success. In the past AppDev teams would support themselves. A team lead or an engineering manager would procure dev tools, lead process, and otherwise manage the support structure of the team so that they are motivated to do good work, and ideally continuously improving. In other cases, an IT admin would deploy standardized dev tools to teams upon request.
