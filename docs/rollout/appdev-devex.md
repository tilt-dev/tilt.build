## AppDev and DevEx

In these docs, we draw a distinction between AppDev (Application Development) and DevEx (Developer Experience), especially as it pertains to rolling out Tilt. Application Developers (or AppDevs) use Tilt as a dev tool to create software products, oftentimes for business users in a typical company context. Developer Experience engineers are one step removed from since _their_ users are the AppDevs themselves. They are most concerned with the experience of developers, as the namesake implies. In particular, they maintain the process and tools to continuously improve the day-to-day experience of AppDevs.

DevEx engineers -> AppDevs -> Business users

## Inheriting the role of DevEx engineer

DevEx addresses the problems from first principles, starting at the user, that is the AppDev. (This is similar to how UX (user experience) in design starts with the end user as well.) As such, the DevEx role is typically filled by a technical individual, because they need to deeply understand the needs of AppDevs, as well as support the tools they use on a daily basis. A company fully invested in DevEx has standardized DevEx processes with dedicated DevEx engineers supporting AppDev teams and departments. But most companies are early in their DevEx journey or just not large enough as an organization that require a dedicated DevEx function. So we've seen DevEx often become the responsibility of infrastructure engineers, since they are the ones often setting up environments and tooling for both production and development. You're probably in a similar role if you're reading this. And so these docs are here to precisely help you support AppDevs as a DevEx engineer. It's [The Missing DevEx Book](../rollout/missing-devex-book).
