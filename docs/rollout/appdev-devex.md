## Emerging need for DevEx

In recent decades, business trends have quickly elevated the demand for effective AppDev (application development). And technology leaders know that empowering AppDevs (application developers) is thus critical for business success. In the past AppDev teams would support themselves. A team lead or an engineering manager would procure dev tools, iterate on process, and otherwise manage the support structure of the team so that they are motivated to do good work, and ideally continuously improving. In other cases, an IT admin would deploy standardized dev tools to teams upon request. But more recently, companies have realized this is still insufficient:

- Motivating AppDevs to do their best work is strategic to getting them in the first place, and retaining them. That means empowering them with the best tools and process, and getting out of their way.
- The space of dev tools is ever-increasing. Cloud-native trends have introduced additional complexity to development in general. Engineering managers and IT admins are often ill-equipped, don't have the expertise, or just don't have the time to support AppDevs effectively with this new set of problems. Consequently, AppDevs are unhappy because they are stuck spending a lot of time supporting themselves, when they are more motivated to create software products to advance the business, not invent dev tools and dev processes.
- And so there's an emerging discipline called DevEx (Developer Experience) to support these now manifest problems.

## Inheriting the role of DevEx engineer

DevEx addresses the problems from first principles, starting at the user, that is the AppDev. (This is similar to how UX (user experience) in design starts with the end user as well.) As such, the DevEx role is typically filled by a technical individual, because they need to deeply understand the needs of AppDevs, as well as support the tools they use on a daily basis. A company fully invested in DevEx has standardized DevEx processes with dedicated DevEx engineers supporting AppDev teams and departments. But most companies are early in their DevEx journey or just not large enough as an organization that requires a dedicated DevEx function. So we've seen DevEx often become the responsibility of infrastructure engineers, since they are the ones often setting up environments and tooling for both production and development. You're probably in a similar role if you're reading this. And so these docs are here to precisely help you support AppDevs as a DevEx engineer. It's [The Missing DevEx Book](../rollout/missing-devex-book).
