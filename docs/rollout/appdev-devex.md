## AppDev and DevEx

In these docs, we draw a distinction between AppDev (Application Development) and DevEx (Developer Experience), especially as it pertains to rolling out Tilt. Application Developers (or AppDevs) use Tilt as a dev tool to create software products, oftentimes for business users in a typical company context. Developer Experience engineers are one step removed since _their_ users are the AppDevs themselves. They are most concerned with the experience of developers, as the namesake implies. In particular, they maintain the process and tools to continuously improve the day-to-day experience of AppDevs. In other words, support flows from left to right below.

DevEx engineers -> AppDevs -> Business users

## Inherit the role of DevEx engineer

DevEx has always existed, but it was not explicitly considered in the past. Even today, many companies embed the function of DevEx engineer in roles such as IT admins or infrastructure engineer. As the reader here, you may be in one of these roles. Going forward, we increasingly see more companies emphasizing DevEx functions and in some cases, with dedicated roles and teams too. We choose the term DevEx in these docs to encourage you inherit the role of DevEx engineer, even if it's not broadly understood by your organization yet. The [discipline is emerging](../rollout/missing-devex-book) as is the role.
