## Finish the POC

As a DevEx engineer, do invest the time in exploring Tilt, possibly creating a POC (Proof of Concept) implementation of the Tiltfile, and getting feedback from a select few AppDevs and other colleagues. But be wary of extending the POC phase too long. Set a clear goal to finish the POC by a given date, so that you can really focus on starting to roll out Tilt to AppDevs, supporting their daily use in a "production" sense.

In particular, Tilt is very feature-rich, and the configurability of the Tiltfile itself means that you have many different ways to continually improve the Tilt experience for your AppDevs. You may be tempted to finish that one more feature before shipping Tilt to your team. Recognize that urge and set an intentional plan to wrap up the POC. You can improve these features over time as you get more feedback from AppDevs. Here are just a few examples of features you may want to hold of perfecting, in the interest of finishing the POC, and moving on to the production phase of your rollout.
