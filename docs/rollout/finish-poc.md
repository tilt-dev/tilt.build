## Finish the POC

As a DevEx engineer, do invest the time in exploring Tilt, possibly creating a POC (Proof of Concept) implementation of the Tiltfile, and getting feedback from a select few AppDevs and other colleagues. But be wary of extending the POC phase too long. Set clear goals for the POC itself ahead of time (what are you trying to prove?). Once those POC goals are achieved, begin the steps to roll out Tilt to AppDevs, supporting their daily use in a "production" sense.

In particular, Tilt is very feature-rich, and the configurability of the Tiltfile itself means that you have many different ways to continually improve the Tilt experience for your AppDevs. You may be tempted to finish that one more feature before shipping Tilt to your team. Recognize that urge and set an intentional plan to wrap up the POC. You can improve these features over time as you get more feedback from AppDevs. Here are just a few examples of features you may want to hold off perfecting, in the interest of finishing the POC, and moving on to the production phase of your rollout.

## Polish a Tilt-enabled Shiny Feature

Once you've finished the POC phase, it doesn't mean you want to immediately ship Tilt to your AppDevs. It's just a mindset shift and a focus shift on what to work on next. In particular, you may want to [polish a Tilt-enabled shiny feature](/rollout/shiny-feature) to really wow your AppDevs as they onboard to Tilt.

## Evaluation

**Use this if**
- You are in the early stages of evaluation and exploring the many possibilities of Tilt.

**Skip this if**
- You've already started shipping Tilt to AppDevs.

**You know it's successful when** you've finished the POC and your conversations with AppDevs and colleagues are now focused on clearing a list of practical, day-to-day blockers as you get ready for a production launch of Tilt.
