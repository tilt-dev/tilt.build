## Leverage a shiny feature to catch a user's attention

Tilt is a powerful tool with a lot of functionality and benefits. The [transition guide](../rollout/introduce-tilt) and [in-product onboarding](../rollout/in-product-onboarding) provide methodical ways to ease some of this complexity. But especially with folks that are bogged down during a busy work day, it's helpful to catch a user's attention with a shiny feature early on during onboarding, in order to really get them interested in seeing how Tilt significantly improves their workflow.

As the DevEx person deploying Tilt, consider leading with a short 2 minute demo in an introductory meeting. Or embedding a gif in an introductory email. Really catch the attention of folks early on.
