## Leverage a shiny feature to catch user attention

Tilt is a powerful tool with a lot of functionality and benefits. The [transition guide](../rollout/introduce-tilt) and [in-product onboarding](../rollout/in-product-onboarding) provide methodical ways to ease some of this complexity. But especially with folks that are bogged down during a busy work day, it's helpful to catch a user's attention with a shiny feature early on during onboarding, in order to really get them interested in seeing how Tilt significantly improves their workflow.

As the DevEx person deploying Tilt, consider leading with a short 2 minute demo in an introductory meeting. Or embedding a gif in an introductory email. Really catch the attention of folks early on.

## Pick a shiny feature that your team will understand

Tilt has many shiny features, in general. But likely only a subset of them would be most relevant to your team and your team's current dev workflow. And even only a few from there would be immediately understandable to your users. So pick one, or at most two Tilt features to wow your users early on. Remember the purpose here is just to get folks hooked and generate excitement. Once they're on board with Tilt, you can spend more time discussing more nuanced functionality.
