## Shiny feature

Tilt is a powerful tool with a lot of functionality and benefits. The [transition guide](../rollout/introduce-tilt) and [in-product onboarding](../rollout/in-product-onboarding) provide methodical ways to ease some of this complexity. But often it's helpful to provide a hook, that is, a shiny feature as it were, to catch a user's attention when they first onboard to Tilt, to really get them interested in seeing how Tilt significantly improves their dev workflow.
