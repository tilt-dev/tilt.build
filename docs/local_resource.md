title: Run Local and/or Occasional Workflows with Local Resource
description: "A technical reference on how to use local build steps in your Tiltfile"
layout: docs

Each entry in your Tilt sidebar is a **resource**---a unit of work managed by Tilt.

The most common type of Tilt resource is one that represents a deployed service, and is made up of
some combination of image build instructions and Kubernetes YAML.

A **local resource** works like any other resource in your sidebar; it
represents a unit of work, and executes either automatically in response to file
changes, or [manually](https://docs.tilt.dev/manual_update_control.html) on
signal from the user. For your resource `MyGreatService`, when one of its file
dependencies changes, its work is to build a Docker image and deploy some k8s
yaml; for a local resource, it's to execute an arbitrary command on your local
filesystem.

You can define a local resource in your Tiltfile as follows:
```python
local_resource('yarn', cmd='yarn install', deps=['package.json'])
```

See the [`local_resource` API spec](api.html#api.local_resource) for more details.

## File dependencies
The `deps` argument allows you to specify file dependencies for your local
resource---either as a string (filepath) or a list of strings (list of filepaths).

When Tilt detects a change to any of a resource's `deps`, the resource will execute
(unless the resource is in `TRIGGER_MODE_MANUAL`, in which case the resource will not
execute, but you'll see the "pending changes" indicator next to your resource in the sidebar).

Specifying `deps` is optional. By default, a local resource without `deps` runs only once:
on `tilt up` (and any time you change its definition in your `Tiltfile`). You can
always manually trigger a local resource (or any resource) with the ["force update" button](https://blog.tilt.dev/2019/11/14/force-update.html):

!["force update" button](assets/img/force-update-button.png)

You might use this pattern to, for instance, define a local resource that refreshes tokens/credentials
needed by your app---you want to do it once on `tilt up`, and every now and then as needed,
but not in response to any particular file changes.

As with `docker_build` and `custom_build`, you can specify files/directories to be
ignored [with the `ignore` argument](http://blog.tilt.dev/2019/06/07/better-monorepo-container-builds-with-context-filters.html).

## Resource dependencies

The `resource_deps` argument allows you to specify the order that resource deps initialize.

A common pattern is to use `local_resource` to run database initialization after
your database comes up in Kubernetes.

See the [Resource Dependencies guide](resource_dependencies.html) for more.

## Parallelism

Local resources can read and write to the local filesystem freely.

Tilt will run local resource build commands in serial with other commands.  This
prevents race conditions: if your local resources are writing files at the same
time as other resources are trying to read them, your build could get into weird
and unpredictable states (especially when writes are only partially completed).

But you can explicitly specify that it's ok to run resources in parallel with:

```
local_resource(name, cmd, allow_parallel=True)
```

Teams sometimes use this to run linters or unit tests that only read local files
but do not write.

## auto_init

By default, a local resource will run on startup. To disable this behavior, put the
resource in `TRIGGER_MODE_MANUAL` and specify `auto_init=False`:
```python
local_resource('reset-db', cmd='reset_db.sh',
    trigger_mode=TRIGGER_MODE_MANUAL, auto_init=False
)
```

For more on trigger mode, [see the docs](https://docs.tilt.dev/manual_update_control.html).

`auto_init=False` is currently only compatible with `TRIGGER_MODE_MANUAL`. If
you'd like a local resource that runs automatically in response to file changes
but does NOT run on `tilt up`, [let us know](https://tilt.dev/contact).

## serve_cmd

`local_resource`'s `serve_cmd` argument allows a local resource to function as a
persistent process, so you can use it for things like running services locally
instead of in k8s, or `tail -f`.

This is named `serve_cmd` because its main intent is to allow the specification
of a command to start a process that runs a server, but it can be used for any
long-running process.

Without `serve_cmd`, a local resource functions as a sort of batch job. Tilt runs
the command and expects it to terminate. While the command is running, it's
"in progress", and when it finishes, it's red or green based on the process's
exit code.

With `serve_cmd`, when the resource updates:
1. Tilt will first run the resource's `cmd`, if it is non-empty.
   1. While you can just put this into your `serve_cmd`, it can be useful to
      separate your "build" step (e.g., `go build ./main.go`) from your "run" step.
   2. When updating a resource, Tilt will not kill the resource's previously
      running process until it's successfully executed `cmd`.
2. If `cmd` succeeds, Tilt will run the resource's `serve_cmd`.
   1. As soon as the `serve_cmd` starts, Tilt will consider the resource updated
      and "running".
   2. If the `serve_cmd` exits, with any exit code, Tilt will consider it an error
      and turn it red.

Some examples:

#### build and run a server locally
``local_resource('local-server', cmd='go build ./cmd/myserver', serve_cmd='./myserver --port=8001', deps=['cmd/myserver'])``

#### keep a port forward open to a service not deployed by Tilt
``local_resource('kube-port-forward', serve_cmd='kubectl port-forward -n openfaas svc/gateway 8080:8080')``

#### show the k8s api server's logs
``local_resource('kube-logs', serve_cmd='kubectl logs -f -n kube-system kube-apiserver-docker-desktop')``

#### custom environment
```python
# will override any values for this key currently in the env
update_env={'CGO_ENABLED': '0'}
# if $PORT set, use that value, else use '8001'}
serve_env={'PORT': os.getenv('PORT', default='8001')}
local_resource('custom-env',
               cmd='go build ./cmd/myserver', env=update_env,
               serve_cmd='./myserver', serve_env=serve_env,
               deps=['cmd/myserver'])
```

## readiness_probe

 Probes for local resources determine whether the `serve_cmd` is considered ready.
 In addition to providing more accurate resource visibility in the Tilt UI, this ensures that Tilt waits for the probe to be successful before starting any dependent resources for the first time.
 Readiness probes are optional; local resources without one are considered ready as soon as the process is started.

 Local resource probes behave very similarly to Kubernetes readiness probes and support similar parameters to adjust the probing period, failure threshold, and more.
 See the [`probe` API spec](api.html#api.probe) for all available options.

 Probes can be an HTTP GET request ([`http_get_action`](api.html#api.http_get_action)), a TCP socket connection ([`tcp_socket_action`](api.html#api.tcp_socket_action)), or a custom program/script ([`exec_action`](api.html#api.exec_action)). The API reference includes details about the specific criteria that determine success for each probe type.

You can configure a `local_resource` with an HTTP GET readiness probe for the `serve_cmd` as follows:
 ```python
local_resource(
   "probe-example",
   serve_cmd="./myserver --port=8001",
   readiness_probe=probe(
      period_secs=15,
      http_get=http_get_action(port=8001, path="/health")
   )
)
 ```
