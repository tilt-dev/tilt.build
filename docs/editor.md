Whether you're just starting or are a seasoned Tilter, writing Tiltfiles should be fun, not tedious.

We're offering Tiltfile support for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and select IDEs of the [JetBrains suite](https://www.jetbrains.com/products/#type=ide).  
All code is public and open source. We appreciate contributions of all kinds.

## VS Code
The [official `Tiltfile` extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tilt-dev.Tiltfile) is available at the VS Code marketplace.  
It provides syntax highlighting, autocomplete and signature support for `Tiltfile` functions.

## TextMate bundles
The [tiltfile.tmbundle](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tiltfile.tmbundle) offers syntax highlighting for any IDEs supporting TextMate bundles, like IntelliJ GoLand, PyCharm or WebStorm.
