A snapshot lets you save your Tilt state, frozen in time. Then, you can later load that Tilt state, which can help with async debugging and adding context to bug reports. 

Since Tilt Cloud is now deprecated, [Snapshots](snapshots.html) is now offline-only.

## Using Offline Snapshots
With Tilt v0.29.0, you can use <code>tilt snapshot create</code> and <code>tilt snapshot view</code> to create snapshots without Tilt Cloud.
