## tilt down

Delete resources created by 'tilt up'

### Synopsis


Deletes resources specified in the Tiltfile

Namespaces are not deleted by default. Use --delete-namespaces to change that.

There are two types of args:
1) Tilt flags, listed below, which are handled entirely by Tilt.
2) Tiltfile args, which can be anything, and are potentially accessed by config.parse in your Tiltfile.

By default:
1) Tiltfile args are interpreted as the list of services to delete, e.g. tilt down frontend backend.
2) Running with no Tiltfile args deletes all services defined in the Tiltfile

This default behavior does not apply if the Tiltfile uses config.parse or config.set_enabled_resources.
In that case, see https://tilt.dev/user_config.html and/or comments in your Tiltfile


```
tilt down [<tilt flags>] [-- <Tiltfile args>]
```

### Options
