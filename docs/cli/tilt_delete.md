## tilt delete

Delete resources by filenames, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector

```
tilt delete ([-f FILENAME] | [-k DIRECTORY] | TYPE [(NAME | -l label | --all)])
```

### Options

```
      --all                             Delete all resources, in the namespace of the specified resource types.
  -A, --all-namespaces                  If present, list the requested object(s) across all namespaces. Namespace in current context is ignored even if specified with --namespace.
      --cascade string[="background"]   Must be "background", "orphan", or "foreground". Selects the deletion cascading strategy for the dependents (e.g. Pods created by a ReplicationController). Defaults to background. (default "background")
      --dry-run string[="unchanged"]    Must be "none", "server", or "client". If client strategy, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it. If server strategy, submit server-side request without persisting the resource. (default "none")
      --field-selector string           Selector (field query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. --field-selector key1=value1,key2=value2). The server only supports a limited number of field queries per type.
  -f, --filename strings                containing the resource to delete.
      --force                           If true, immediately remove resources from API and bypass graceful deletion. Note that immediate deletion of some resources may result in inconsistency or data loss and requires confirmation.
      --grace-period int                Period of time in seconds given to the resource to terminate gracefully. Ignored if negative. Set to 1 for immediate shutdown. Can only be set to 0 when --force is true (force deletion). (default -1)
  -h, --help                            help for delete
      --host string                     Host for the Tilt HTTP server. Only necessary if you started Tilt with --host. Overrides TILT_HOST env variable. (default "localhost")
      --ignore-not-found                Treat "resource not found" as a successful delete. Defaults to "true" when --all is specified.
  -k, --kustomize string                Process a kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.
      --now                             If true, resources are signaled for immediate shutdown (same as --grace-period=1).
  -o, --output string                   Output mode. Use "-o name" for shorter output (resource/name).
      --port int                        Port for the Tilt HTTP server. Only necessary if you started Tilt with --port. Overrides TILT_PORT env variable. (default 10350)
      --raw string                      Raw URI to DELETE to the server.  Uses the transport specified by the kubeconfig file.
  -R, --recursive                       Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
  -l, --selector string                 Selector (label query) to filter on.
      --timeout duration                The length of time to wait before giving up on a delete, zero means determine a timeout from the size of the object
      --wait                            If true, wait for resources to be gone before returning. This waits for finalizers. (default true)
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -d, --debug      Enable debug logging
      --klog int   Enable Kubernetes API logging. Uses klog v-levels (0-4 are debug logs, 5-9 are tracing logs)
  -v, --verbose    Enable verbose logging
