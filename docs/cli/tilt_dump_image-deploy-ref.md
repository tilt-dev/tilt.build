## tilt dump image-deploy-ref

Determine the name and tag with which Tilt will deploy the given image

### Synopsis

Determine the name and tag with which Tilt will deploy the given image.

This command is intended to be used with custom_build scripts.

Once the custom_build script has built the image at $EXPECTED_REF, it can
invoke:

echo $(tilt dump image-deploy-ref $EXPECTED_REF)

to print the deploy ref of the image. Tilt will read the image contents,
determine its hash, and create a content-based tag.

More info on custom build scripts: https://docs.tilt.dev/custom_build.html
