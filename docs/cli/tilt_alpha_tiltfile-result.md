## tilt alpha tiltfile-result

Exec the Tiltfile and print data about execution. By default, prints Tiltfile execution results as JSON (note: the API is unstable and may change); can also print timings of Tiltfile Builtin calls.

### Synopsis

Exec the Tiltfile and print data about execution. By default, prints Tiltfile execution results as JSON (note: the API is unstable and may change); can also print timings of Tiltfile Builtin calls.

Exit code 0: successful Tiltfile evaluation (data printed to stdout)
Exit code 1: some failure in setup, printing results, etc. (any logs printed to stderr)
Exit code 5: error when evaluating the Tiltfile, such as syntax error, illegal Tiltfile operation, etc. (any logs printed to stderr)

Run with -v | --verbose to print Tiltfile execution logs on stderr, regardless of whether there was an error.

```
tilt alpha tiltfile-result [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -b, --builtin-timings          If true, print timing data for Tiltfile builtin calls instead of Tiltfile result JSON
      --context string           Kubernetes context override. Equivalent to kubectl --context
      --dur-threshold duration   Only compatible with Builtin Timings mode. Should be a Go duration string. If passed, only print information about builtin calls lasting this duration and longer.
  -f, --file string              Path to Tiltfile (default "Tiltfile")
  -h, --help                     help for tiltfile-result
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

      --klog int   Enable Kubernetes API logging. Uses klog v-levels (0-4 are debug logs, 5-9 are tracing logs)
