## tilt

Multi-service development with no stress

### Synopsis


Tilt helps you develop your microservices locally.
Run 'tilt up' to start working on your services in a complete dev environment
configured for your team.

Tilt watches your files for edits, automatically builds your container images,
and applies any changes to bring your environment
up-to-date in real-time. Think 'docker build && kubectl apply' or 'docker-compose up'.


### Options

```
  -d, --debug                          Enable debug logging
  -h, --help                           help for tilt
      --klog int                       Enable Kubernetes API logging. Uses klog v-levels (0-4 are debug logs, 5-9 are tracing logs)
      --log-flush-frequency duration   Maximum number of seconds between log flushes (default 5s)
      --trace                          Enable tracing
      --traceBackend string            Which tracing backend to use. Valid values are: 'windmill', 'lightstep', 'jaeger' (default "windmill")
