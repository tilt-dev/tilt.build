## DevEx is an Art, not a Science


From supporting Developer Experience (DevEx) in previous jobs at Google, Medium, and Twitter and then helping teams adopt Tilt,
we've picked up tricks of the trade that can help you roll out a new tool.
**If you like Tilt and want to share it with your team, this page is for you.**

This site groups articles into sections on:
* **Background** about how to think about supporting a tool
* **Configure** Tilt to be used by a team and not just an individual
* **Onboard** new teammates to Tilt
* **Support** teammates that are trying and using Tilt

## Talk To Tilt
We don't just write software; we know how to make developer tools matter. We can help you apply these strategies (or craft a plan specific to your org). [Schedule a chat](https://calendly.com/dbentley/tilt-enterprise) and we'll help you get your team onto Tilt for free in exchange for refining this advice.

## Background

If you're considering Tilt, you care about your team's developer experience. Background articles explain the relationship between Developer Experience (DevEx) and Application Development (AppDev) so you can support dev tools better. (Especially if AppDev is your primary job and DevEx is a side project.)

## Configure

Configure articles explain how to make Tilt work best for your team (and how that may be different from the Tiltfiles you write when you're exploring Tilt for yourself).

## Onboard

Onboard articles show how a little time crafting an onboarding experience for your team can let them experience the best parts of Tilt soonest.


## Support

Support articles describe how to get the right feedback from Tilt users on your team. Rolling out a new tool can generate too little feedback or too much.
We explain how to find the right signal to help your team most without getting bogged down in an infinite backlog of issues.
