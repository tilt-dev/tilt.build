title: Using Helm with Tilt
layout: docs
---

Tilt supports Helm out-of-the-box.

There are two ways you can use Helm charts with Tilt.

## Basic Helm

If you have a local Helm chart and want to deploy it as-is, add a `helm()` call to your `Tiltfile`:

```python
k8s_yaml(helm('path/to/chart/dir'))
```

The `helm` function runs `helm template` on a chart directory and returns the generated yaml.

When you make edits to the files in the chart directory, Tilt will automatically re-deploy the chart.

## Advanced Helm

Helm can also do more advanced templating -- like downloading remote charts and injecting run-time variables.

Fortunately, Tilt has a plugin API. You can tell it how to shell out to other build and deploy tools.

The plugin API has two important functions:

- `local()` for running local shell commands

- `watch_file()` for telling Tilt to reload its configuration when a file changes

Let's take a look at some common recipes for using the plugin API with Helm.

### Example Repo

If you prefer to play with a code sample, see

[windmilleng/tilt-helm-demo](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt-helm-demo)

### Re-implementing the `helm()` built-in

To start, let's try implementing the `helm()` built-in ourselves.

```
k8s_yaml(local('helm template path/to/chart/dir'))
watch_file('path/to/chart/dir')
```

The real `helm()` built-in handles some extra optimizations and edge cases, but that's basically all it does!

### Passing a single variable

Now that we know how to shell out to `helm`, we can pass arbitrary flags. Let's try using `--set` to set a variable.

```
k8s_yaml(local('helm template --set key1=val1,key2=val2 path/to/chart/dir'))
watch_file('path/to/chart/dir')
```

### Passing a values file

If you're passing a lot of variables, it's usually better to put those in a values.yaml file.

```
k8s_yaml(local('helm template -f ./values.yaml path/to/chart/dir'))
watch_file('path/to/chart/dir')
watch_file('values.yaml')
```

### Deploying a remote Helm chart

One of the advantages of Helm is that there's a rich library of existing charts.

Suppose you want to ensure Redis is installed in your dev environment. You can add this line to your `Tiltfile`:

```
local("helm upgrade --install redis-dev stable/redis")
```

This fetches the remote Redis chart and deploys it to your cluster.

But maybe you want to tweak the existing chart a bit. Then you might use `local()` to call `helm fetch`:

```
fetch_script = "helm fetch stable/myProject --untar --untardir ./deploy/helm/"
template_script = "helm template ./deploy/helm/myProject --namespace {} --name {} -f ./deploy/helm/myProject/values.yaml".format(namespace, release_name)
k8s_yaml(local(fetch_script + " && " + template_script))
```

### Other Helm tools

There are other helm tools like [helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile) for working with Helm charts.

We can use the same plugin commands to implement those as well. In this example, we factor out `helmfile` into a helper function.

```
# Helper function to read K8s config YAML from helmfile.
#
# Currently `helmfile template` has a bug where it prints messages to stdout instead of stderr
# https://github.com/roboll/helmfile/issues/551
# So we use the workaround suggested there.
def helmfile(file):
  watch_file(file)
  return local("helmfile -f %s template | grep -v -e '^Decrypting .*' | grep -v -e '^Fetching .*' | grep -v 'as it is not a table.$'" % file)

# Tell Tilt to apply to k8s config generated by helmfile.
k8s_yaml(helmfile("k8s/staging/helmfile.yaml"))
```

You can try out this example yourself in [this example repo](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt-helmfile-demo).

### Further customization

If you have a Helm use-case that's not covered here, we'd love to hear about it!

You can [file an issue](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt/issues) on GitHub.
