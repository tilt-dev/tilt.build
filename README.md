# tilt.build

Tilt landing page, docs page, and blog page

- https://tilt.dev/
- https://docs.tilt.dev/
- https://blog.tilt.dev/

## Developing

0) Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

1) Install [Tilt](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt)

2) Run `tilt up`

The landing page will be running at http://localhost:4000/.

The docs page will be running at http://localhost:4001/.

The blog page will be running at http://localhost:4002/.

Edits to the markdown will auto-update the HTML.
The landing page lives under src and the docs page lives under docs.
The docs directory has symlinks to share stuff with the landing page.

When you're finished, merge to master and Netlify will auto-deploy the site.

### API docs

The API docs are a little bit more complicated.

We write the API docs as docstrings in Python files in the main
[Tilt repo](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt). Then, during the
release pipeline (`release-update-tilt-docs.sh`), the files are
generated and updated here (under `api/api`), Sphinx generates HTML
fragments (`make api`), and then Jekyll serves that HTML fragment.

The autogenerated API Python files include instructions on
how to edit the source content.
