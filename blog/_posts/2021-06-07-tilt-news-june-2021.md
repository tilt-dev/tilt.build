Happy June Tilt Users! This monthâ€™s newsletter contains an invitation to get
help with onboarding, a grab-bag of content goodness and an introduction to our
newest Tilters!

## Introducing Tilt Liftoff

Tilt Liftoff is a new program weâ€™re kicking off designed to help you kick-off a
Tilt rollout to your team. You get dedicated engineering support, access to our
world-class user research team, and emotional support for when things get
tough. Plus, itâ€™s completely free. Check out the details
[here](https://tilt.dev/liftoff).

In this [tongue-in-cheek 2-minute
video](https://twitter.com/ellenkorbes/status/1400139022580826117), Tiltâ€™s Head
of Product Ellen KÃ¶rbes shows us what the future of software development looks
like. With over 100K views, this *ahem* software development philosophy has
really hit a nerve with the dev community, and it shows a cool demo of Tiltâ€™s
new APIâ€™s capabilities to boot. (See links on the twitter thread for 1080p
version and the source code.)

## Welcome New Tilters

In May we welcomed [two new Tilters](https://tilt.dev/about), Lizz Thabet and
Lucie le Blanc. Lizz joins us as a frontend engineer, while Lucie is a software
engineer intern. Feel free to give them a wave on [our slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T09NY5SBT/CESBL84MV/).

## Tilt Blogâ€™s Latest

Weâ€™ve recently started sharing the inside scoops of our development process in the Tilt blog, and itâ€™s been going at full steam.

In [Nobody Knows How Many Servers They Need to Run Their
App](https://blog.tilt.dev/2021/04/30/how-many-servers.html) Tiltâ€™s CTO Nick
Santos talks about how Tiltâ€™s innards now run on a Kubernetes API server model,
and why we think thatâ€™s a good idea. And in [Three Ways to Run Kubernetes on CI
and Which One is Right for
You!](https://blog.tilt.dev/2021/04/02/kubernetes-on-ci.html) Nick talks about -
well, that oneâ€™s pretty self explanatory ðŸ˜….

## KubeCon Europe 2021

Last month Ellen presented a talk titled [Hacking into Kubernetes Security for
Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLsCm9GVIQg) alongside Datadogâ€™s
System Security Engineer Tabitha Sable.

It takes viewers along for the basic concepts of Kubernetes security, in a
narrative format thatâ€™s fun to follow and easy to understand. It was a huge hit
among the Kubernetes community, and if youâ€™re looking to get started in
Kubernetes security, definitely check it out.
