Hallo Tilters,

Big announcement incoming: we have redesigned the Tilt experience! ðŸ¥³  
Today weâ€™re taking a look at our onboarding tutorial. Most of you who are reading this are probably already acquainted with Tiltâ€” and donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ve got something coming for you, too, but:

As one can only make one first impression, it better count, right? With that in mind, we wanted to create an onboarding experience that is quick, easy and fun, even if a user is starting from zero. (So yes, if you've been looking for the perfect way to introduce Tilt to your colleagues, this is it!)

## Onboarding yourself

So we went out, collected, considered and reflected on the feedback all of you provided (thanks again for that!) and overhauled the entire thing!  
The new tutorial helps you to get Tilt up and running with just one command, so you can quickly tour Tiltâ€™s best features, and learn about all the possibilities to boost your developer workflow.  
All you need to get started, is Docker, Tilt and the sample source code. Youâ€™ll be able to play around with an actual multiservice application and see Tilt in action. [Try it out yourself](https://docs.tilt.dev/tutorial/index.html) and let us know what you think.

If youâ€™d rather learn how to write your first Tiltfile to start, the [old tutorial](https://docs.tilt.dev/tiltfile_authoring.html) is still up.

## Onboarding your friends

Still reading? Excellent!  
Next step: getting your colleagues and managers on board! You might have asked yourself before: How can I quickly show Tilt to my buddy, but on their machine?  
To help you with that, weâ€™ve created a self-contained demo. Just run `tilt demo` and Tilt will spin up an entire dev cluster for you with our sample application. From scratch!
