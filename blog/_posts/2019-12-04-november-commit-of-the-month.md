# November Commit of the Month

November's commit of the month is [a0b0213e8b3849f9c4aa7fe48461ed5a7231267f](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt/commit/a0b0213e8b3849f9c4aa7fe48461ed5a7231267f)!

This commit allows Tilt to bind to a custom host in addition to a port when it configures [port forwards](https://docs.tilt.dev/api.html#api.k8s_resource) on resources. For example, if you're running Tilt on a remote virtual machine you could set a port forward like: `k8s_resource('foo', port_forwards='192.168.1.5:8000')`. Or, if you want to accept connections from any host: `k8s_resource('foo', port_forwards='0.0.0.0:8000')`.

This enables some cool workflows if you share a network with your team. Imagine iterating with a designer and, seconds after you press “save”, they can see the current state of the page that you’re working on!
