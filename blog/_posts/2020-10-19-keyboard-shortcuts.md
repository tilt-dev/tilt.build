The [latest version of Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html) now has keyboard shortcuts! Type <kbd>?</kbd> or click the question icon to display a modal with all the shortcuts. We know developers love keyboard shortcuts, and it shouldn't have taken us this long to implement them. But better late than never!

Earlier in the year [we compared the terminal GUI with the browser GUI](/2020/06/19/the-right-display-for-now.html). The terminal GUI has always supported a rich keyboard interaction model. And so we wanted to bring similar benefits to the browser too. Just because you're looking at a browser tab, that doesn't mean you should necessary rely on mouse input to use Tilt. And so as we explore new ways to display information in the browser, we want to allow you to easily move around without leaving the keyboard. [Let us know what you think](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt/issues) and how we can improve.
