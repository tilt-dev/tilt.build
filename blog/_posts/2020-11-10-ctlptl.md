At Tilt, we want to make Kubernetes an approachable environment for local dev.

We found ourselves spending a lot of time helping teams debug misconfigurations
with their local cluster.

We wrote docs like [Choosing a local dev
cluster](https://docs.tilt.dev/choosing_clusters.html) and example repos like
[kind-local](https://github.com/tilt-dev/kind-local),
[minikube-local](https://github.com/tilt-dev/minikube-local), and
[k3d-local](https://github.com/tilt-dev/k3d-local) to help people get set up.

`ctlptl` is a culmination of what we've learned.

## What is `ctlptl`?

[`ctlptl`](https://github.com/tilt-dev/ctlptl) is a CLI for declaratively setting up local Kubernetes clusters.

Inspired by `kubectl` and
[ClusterAPI's](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api) `clusterctl`, you
declare your local cluster with YAML and use `ctlptl` to set it up.

## How should I pronounce `ctlptl`?

We've talked a lot about this. We're not any closer to a single answer. We've
decided that these are all acceptable pronounciations:

- Cattle paddle
- Control pedal
- Cartel patrol
- Cuddle petal
- Cuttle puddle

## Who is `ctlptl` for?

`ctlptl` is a building block for platform teams setting up a multi-service dev environments locally.

To have a consistent environment across machines, you need to be able to stitch together:

- a dev cluster
- a dev registry
- storage
- mounts
- cpu
- memory

If one of these is off (e.g., one dev accidentally set their CPU too low), the
environment is awful and uncomfortable.

`ctlptl` helps a single dev easily set up their dev environment according to
best practices. A maintainer can give their team a one-liner for easy cluster
setup.

## Where do I start?

Check out [ctlptl on GitHub](https://github.com/tilt-dev/ctlptl) for installation instructions
and [example configs](https://github.com/tilt-dev/ctlptl#examples).

To learn more about the pros and cons of different local dev clusters, [Ellen
KÃ¶rbes can teach you how to break it down on
