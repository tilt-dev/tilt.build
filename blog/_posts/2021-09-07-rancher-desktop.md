### üì£ Update (February 2022)
We've revamped this blog post to reflect recent changes to both Tilt and [Rancher Desktop][rancher-desktop].

The good news? It's easier than ever to use Tilt and [Rancher Desktop][rancher-desktop] together!

(There is no bad news.)

---

[Rancher Desktop][rancher-desktop] is a new way to run Kubernetes on macOS and Windows.

As a user, there are many similarities with Docker Desktop: Rancher Desktop manages a transparent VM with a container runtime and a single-node development Kubernetes cluster.

However, behind the scenes, there's a couple notable differences:
 * By default, Rancher Desktop uses [containerd][] instead of Docker
 * Rancher Desktop uses [k3s][] as the Kubernetes cluster ([k3s][] is a a lightweight, certified Kubernetes distribution also maintained by Rancher)

As a Docker Desktop moving to Rancher Desktop, the quickest way (I did promise you could do this in 5 minutes after all!) is to configure Rancher Desktop to use Docker as the container runtime.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Watch Out!
You cannot run both Docker Desktop and Rancher Desktop (in `dockerd` mode) simultaneously!
See [rancher-desktop#1081][rd-issues-1081] for details.

---

Go ahead and open the Rancher Desktop preferences and choose `dockerd (moby)` as the Container Runtime in the "Kubernetes Settings" section:

Once selected, Rancher Desktop will prompt you to confirm before resetting the cluster.

After it's started back up...you're done!

Tilt (as of v0.25.1+) will automatically detect your Rancher Desktop with `dockerd` configuration and use it for any [`docker_build`][tiltfile-docker-build] calls.

Similar to using Docker Desktop with its built-in Kubernetes support, no local registry or image pushes are required.
This is possible because Tilt is building _directly_ to the container runtime (`dockerd`) used by the cluster node, so building the image also makes it available for use by Pods.
If this sounds a bit complex - we agree!
Hopefully, you never have to think about it because Tilt takes care of finding the optimal strategy based on your configuration **automatically**.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è If you use `docker` via the CLI, you might notice a bunch of running containers, including Kubernetes cluster components as well as any Pods you have deployed.
> You should avoid manipulating these directly via Docker to avoid conflicting with Rancher Desktop.

[Rancher Desktop][rancher-desktop] is still very new and evolving fast!
We're always excited to see new tools in the local Kubernetes space - if you're using Rancher Desktop with Tilt, [let us know][tilt-contact] ‚ù§Ô∏è
