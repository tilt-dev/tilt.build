There has been _a lot_ happening [under the hood](/2021/04/30/how-many-servers.html) recently, and we're excited to introduce the first step towards enhanced Tilt dashboard customization!

With the [latest Tilt release](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt/releases/latest), you can add custom buttons to a resource in the Tilt dashboard.

One of Tilt's many superpowers is automatically doing the right thing at the right time for your services, and sometimes the right time is when _you_ decide to do something.

I often find myself with a collection of service-specific commands that, while part of my development workflow, don't really fit in as a full-fledged Tilt resource.
This might be a command to reset the dev database to a clean slate, an artisanal curl command to launch a data processing job, or anything else!

Whatever it is, having a button at the ready on the resource in Tilt beats tapping up repeatedly to cycle through terminal history looking for that magic command a co-worker sent via Slack six months ago.

To add a button to a resource, we can use the [uibutton extension][uibutton-ext]:
```python
load('ext://uibutton', 'cmd_button', 'location')

# create a button to run the linter for the 'frontend' resource
cmd_button(name='lint',
           resource='frontend',
           argv=['yarn', 'run', 'eslint', '.'])
```

When running `tilt up`, our new "lint" button shows up on the `frontend` resource and the command output gets interspersed with the rest of the resource logs.
The command is executed on the host running `tilt up` (similar to `local_resource`).

See the [uibutton extension][uibutton-ext] for more detailed usage and complete API reference.

We are just scratching the surface of dashboard customization so that you can fully personalize Tilt to your workflow.
[Let us know](https://docs.tilt.dev/#community) how you use custom buttons in your project!
