While you’re waiting, complain to us about it! What makes you productive, and what sucks up time?

Please don’t spend more than 3 minutes on this survey. If you’re waiting longer than 3 minutes for your build, you have our deepest sympathies.

[You can fill out the survey by clicking here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhHckSoH8bGZoFEMNFalVDC7vKVhv8WvnnrN1-PDJA1xG7tQ/viewform) We also embedded it below but it’s kind of janky. I personally prefer the full-page experience.
