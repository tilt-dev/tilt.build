Windmill Engineering knows that you probably spend much of your day waiting for your code to compile and tests to run and servers to start.

While you’re waiting, complain to us about it! What makes you productive, and what sucks up time?

Please don’t spend more than 3 minutes on this survey. If you’re waiting longer than 3 minutes for your build, you have our deepest sympathies.

[You can fill out the survey by clicking here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhHckSoH8bGZoFEMNFalVDC7vKVhv8WvnnrN1-PDJA1xG7tQ/viewform) We also embedded it below but it’s kind of janky. I personally prefer the full-page experience.
