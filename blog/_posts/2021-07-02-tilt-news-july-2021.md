Hello Tilters, we hope you’re having a great Thursday! Here’s some interesting
things we’re excited to show you today:

## Decorate With More Buttons

Tilters often use `local_resource()` to add clickable items onto Tilt’s
interface. But sometimes that functionality is specific to a single service, and
unless you’re looking at the service in question, you don’t really want it
cluttering your view.

With that in mind, meet [UIButton](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt-extensions/tree/master/uibutton)!

With the UIButton extension you can add functionality directly into the resource
view page of any specific service.

This way it’s easy to see what commands are relevant to a specific service, and
it also helps de-clutter your resources list. And it’s pretty easy to use, too:

```python
load('ext://uibutton', 'cmd_button')

cmd_button(name='Hello World',
           resource='my-resource',
           argv=['echo', 'Hello World'])
```

Milas wrote more about it in [this blog
post](https://blog.tilt.dev/2021/06/21/uibutton.html). Let us know what you
think of it!

## Which Files Are We Watching Now?

As we’ve mentioned a few times, Tilt’s innards are moving towards a Kubernetes-style API, following an object/controller model. This is great because it allows anyone to interact with Tilt’s inner processes and look under the hood, as opposed to the tool being blackbox. 

[In this post](https://blog.tilt.dev/2021/05/07/eyes-on-the-watchers.html), Nick
talks about one of Tilt’s most quintessential tasks, file watching, and how you
can hack around with the file watching API under Tilt’s new system.

## The Foundations of Computer Science

Ellen just won’t stop with their shenanigans. This time we’re getting a lesson
on how to bring one of the core tenets of computer science up-to-date to the
21st century. It shows an integration between Tilt’s internals and an external
application.

Be warned, it’s [funny](https://twitter.com/ellenkorbes/status/1405879387132731399).

## Work-In-Progress Development vs. Harness Development

Some days ago we got a question on Slack about the difference between workflows
like CI and GitOps, and tools like Tilt, Skaffold, and so on.

They’re sort of similar, but fundamentally different! They work really well
together, and you should definitely use both types of tools in your setup.

If you’re not sure what the distinctions are, check out [this
