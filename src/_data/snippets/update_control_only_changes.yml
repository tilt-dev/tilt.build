title: Wait to launch resource until first file change
description: |
  Configure a resource to not launch until the first file dependency changes after launching `tilt up`
  (works with all resource types, e.g. k8s_resource, local_resource, and dc_resource).
  Suggested use case: linters, unit tests.
code: |
  # Kubernetes `my-resource` will wait for a file in the image build context to change before start
  k8s_resource("my-resource", auto_init=False, trigger_mode=TRIGGER_MODE_AUTO)
  
  # Local resource `my-resource` will wait for a file in `./my-resource` to change before start
  local_resource("my-resource", serve_cmd="./run.sh", auto_init=False, trigger_mode=TRIGGER_MODE_AUTO, deps=['./my-resource'])
  
  # Docker Compose `my-resource` will wait for a file in the image build context to change before start
  dc_resource("my-resouce", auto_init=False, trigger_mode=TRIGGER_MODE_AUTO)
