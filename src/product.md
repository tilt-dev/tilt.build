### Who We Are

Windmill Engineering is building the platform for cloud-native development.

Our first product, Tilt, focuses on local microservice development for
engineering teams. We believe if Tilt can get teams to a place where
they prefer doing all their development in local containers, then that opens up
entirely new possibilities for the development lifecycle.

In the same way that git led to a GitHub platform that transformed how
developers collaborate on source code, Kubernetes will lead to a platform that
fundamentally changes how developers collaborate on servers.

We’re looking for a Head of Product to help us shape the strategy on how to get
there, operating at the nexus of developer experience, code collaboration,
orchestration and more.

We are currently a startup of 7 people, backed by top VCs. We expect this role
to scale as the company grows. What you’re doing in your first month will look
very different than what you’re doing a year in.

### What You'll Do
- Shape both product priorities and product marketing strategy.
- Set up better systems for how we collect feedback from our existing design
  partners.
- Distill common trends in how people are using Tilt, and using those insights,
  anticipate how people could use Tilt in the future.
- Seek out communities of developers that would find value in Tilt, and build a
  roadmap of how to convert them into active users and evangelists.
- Surface user needs in the ecosystem around Tilt, and what new tools are needed
  in that ecosystem.
- Partner with our engineering team to translate user needs into capabilities we
  need to build for Tilt, in both the short term and the long term.
- Help us build a team culture where everyone's doing their best work

### Our Ideal Candidate
- Lives in the New York City, or would be willing to relocate.
- Has written code professionally. We do not expect this role to involve any
  coding, but it will be hard to succeed in this role without a strong
  understanding of developer workflow.
- Familiar with Docker, containers, microservices, and Kubernetes. Can explain
  what problems they solve.
- Has previous experience in both large and small technology companies where
  they have launched and scaled a product.
