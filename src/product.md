### Our Mission

Windmill Engineering is building the platform for cloud-native development. Imagine if every time you hit save, you could kick off workflows that run in the cloud, with results that are accessible across your team instantly and historically. How much more productive could you be with faster workflows? What workflows have we not even thought of yet?

### About Us

This is a big mission, and we're a small team (6 people, based in NYC's Union Square).

We're software engineers and toolsmiths. We've built developer tools and consumer products. Nick and Dan (founders) met working at Google on projects like Google Sheets, Google Code, and others. We think cloud-native products like GitHub and Google Sheets are great because of the new workflows they enable. We're excited to be working towards it.

We want to be a better company in an industry that's been neither diverse nor inclusive. Each month, we give $100/employee to an org that's making tech less toxic. We recognize "meritocracy" and "work hard, play hard" as culture smells.

### Our First Product

Tilt relieves the pains of local Kubernetes microservice development. It already automates and optimizes container image builds, and has a Heads-Up Display UI that saves you from having to play 20 questions with kubectl. But which pains do we relieve next? What features relieve them fastest or best?

We need a Head of Product to help us answer those questions and shape our strategy and story.

### What You'll Do
- Shape product priorities.
- Set up better systems for how we collect feedback from users.
- Distill common trends in how people are using Tilt, and using those insights,
  anticipate how people could use Tilt in the future.
- Seek out communities of developers that would find value in Tilt, and build a
  roadmap of how to convert them into active users and evangelists.
- Surface user needs in the ecosystem around Tilt, and what new tools are needed
  in that ecosystem.
- Partner with our engineering team to translate user needs into capabilities we
  need to build for Tilt, in both the short term and the long term.
- Help us communicate the longer vision, in addition to the near-term product.
- Help us build a team culture where everyone's doing their best work

### Our Ideal Candidate
- Lives in New York City, or would be willing to relocate.
- Has written code professionally. We do not expect this role to involve any
  coding, but it will be hard to succeed in this role without a strong
  understanding of developer workflow.
- Familiar with Docker, containers, microservices, and Kubernetes. Can explain
  what problems they solve.
- Has previous experience in both large and small technology companies.
    Has both launched and scaled a product.

### Interested? Apply.
Even if you don't have experience or interest in every bullet, we want to hear from you. There's no perfect candidate, and we want to find the right fit, even if it's different than we imagine. We especially would like to meet underrepresented/underestimated candidates.
