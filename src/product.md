### Our First Product

Tilt relieves the pains of local Kubernetes microservice development. It already automates and optimizes container image builds, and has a Heads-Up Display UI that saves you from having to play 20 questions with kubectl. But which pains do we relieve next? What features relieve them fastest or best?

We need a Head of Product to help us answer those questions and shape our strategy and story.

### What You'll Do
- Shape product priorities.
- Set up better systems for how we collect feedback from users.
- Distill common trends in how people are using Tilt, and using those insights,
  anticipate how people could use Tilt in the future.
- Seek out communities of developers that would find value in Tilt, and build a
  roadmap of how to convert them into active users and evangelists.
- Surface user needs in the ecosystem around Tilt, and what new tools are needed
  in that ecosystem.
- Partner with our engineering team to translate user needs into capabilities we
  need to build for Tilt, in both the short term and the long term.
- Help us communicate the longer vision, in addition to the near-term product.
- Help us build a team culture where everyone's doing their best work

### Our Ideal Candidate
- Lives in New York City, or would be willing to relocate.
- Has written code professionally. We do not expect this role to involve any
  coding, but it will be hard to succeed in this role without a strong
  understanding of developer workflow.
- Familiar with Docker, containers, microservices, and Kubernetes. Can explain
  what problems they solve.
- Has previous experience in both large and small technology companies.
    Has both launched and scaled a product.

### Interested? Apply.
Even if you don't have experience or interest in every bullet, we want to hear from you. There's no perfect candidate, and we want to find the right fit, even if it's different than we imagine. We especially would like to meet underrepresented/underestimated candidates.
