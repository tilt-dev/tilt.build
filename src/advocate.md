title: "Seeking: Developer Advocate"

### Our Mission

Windmill Engineering is building the platform for cloud-native development. Imagine if every time you hit save, you could kick off workflows that run in the cloud, with results that are accessible across your team instantly and historically. How much more productive could you be with faster workflows? What workflows have we not even thought of yet?

### About Us

This is a big mission, and we're a small team (6 people, based in NYC's Union Square).

We're software engineers and toolsmiths. We've built developer tools and consumer products. Nick and Dan (founders) met working at Google on projects like Google Sheets, Google Code, and others. We think cloud-native products like GitHub and Google Sheets are great because of the new workflows they enable. We're excited to be working towards it.

We want to be a better company in an industry that's been neither diverse nor inclusive. Each month, we give $100/employee to an org that's making tech less toxic. We recognize "meritocracy" and "work hard, play hard" as culture smells.

### Our First Product

Tilt relieves the pains of local Kubernetes microservice development. It already automates and optimizes container image builds, and has a Heads-Up Display UI that saves you from having to play 20 questions with kubectl. If you use Kubernetes for production, you need Tilt for development.

We need a Developer Advocate who can help us build a community of Tilt users. We know this can go by many names (DevRel, Dev Evangelism, etc.), but we know we aren't great at it. We love Ashley McNamara's [post describing the role](https://medium.com/@ashleymcnamara/what-is-developer-advocacy-3a92442b627c): "the real goal of a Developer Advocate is to become the voice of the user. We gather feedback in a way developers canâ€™t (since they know the codebase too well), then use that feedback to shape the product to become what it needs to be."

### What You'll Do
- Organize the Tilt community. Across Slack channels, meetups, Twitter, and wherever else it makes sense.
- Learn from our community. What's hurting them that brings them to Tilt? What's still hurting after they pick up Tilt?
- Fight for the user. Bring what you've learned to help us improve the product, by advocating within our company. What bugs are we dropping on the floor?
- Tell Tilt's story. Blogs, conferences, documentation, workshops, sample apps.
- Create systems so the whole team contributes to telling Tilt's story (it's too much for one person)
- Help us reach more users to become the ubiquitous tool for microservice dev.
- Stay informed of what's happening in tech. What's the latest Kubernetes distribution? How is Go's module system going to impact container builds?
- Find communities we're missing that would benefit from cloud-native dev. Does data science need Tilt? Is Tilt a game changer for game devs?

### Our Ideal Candidate
- Has been a dev advocate on a small- or mid-sized team. Because we're small and you'll be our first dev advocate, we think you need prior experience to succeed here.
- Active in the Kubernetes community. (Or a related developer community)
- Spends time with the team in New York City, even if you live elsewhere. (This would be our first remote role; as former remote employees ourselves we know it's important to be upfront and to work on it)

### Interested? Apply.
Even if you don't have experience or interest in every bullet, we want to hear from you. There's no perfect candidate, and we want to find the right fit, even if it's different than we imagine. We especially would like to meet underrepresented/underestimated candidates.
