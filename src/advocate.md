title: "Seeking: Developer Advocate"

{% include job_intro.md %}

### Our First Product

Kubernetes' fundamental insight is that you can't operate multiple services by
starting them up and forgetting about them. You need a control loop to monitor
their status and fix problems.

Tilt believes that the same is true for dev environments. Bash isn't the right
tool for scripting a dev environment with multiple services. You need a tool
that let's you specify services, display their status, and fix problems.

As we build more extensions, we want developers to be able to set up the dev
environments they need in an afternoon, whether it's with first-party flagship
extensions or ones they've hacked together themselves.

We need a Developer Advocate to help us build a community of people
and tools that solve this problem.

### What You'll Do

- Organize the Tilt community. Across Slack channels, meetups, Twitter, and
  wherever else it makes sense.

- Learn from our community. What's hurting them that brings them to Tilt? What's
  still hurting after they pick up Tilt?

- Fight for the user. Bring what you've learned to help us improve the product,
  by advocating within our company. What bugs are we dropping on the floor?

- Tell Tilt's story. Blogs, conferences, documentation, workshops, sample apps.

- Create systems so the whole team contributes to telling Tilt's story (it's too
  much for one person)

- Help us reach more users to become the ubiquitous tool for microservice dev.

- Stay informed of what's happening in tech. What's the latest Kubernetes
  distribution? How is Go's module system going to impact container builds?

- Find communities we're missing that would benefit from cloud-native dev. Does
  data science need Tilt? Is Tilt a game changer for game devs?

### Our Ideal Candidate

- Has been a dev advocate on a small- or mid-sized team. Because we're small and
  you'll be our only dev advocate, we think you need prior experience to
  succeed here.

- Active in the Kubernetes community, or a related developer community.

- Most of our team is in NYC and works on East coast US time. Our Head of
  Product is in Berlin. We think it will be important to collaborate across both
  of those timezones, even if you live elsewhere.
