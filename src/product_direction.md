The continuously changing general product direction of Tilt and Tilt Cloud is based on conversations with existing and potential users, and our current thinking of multi-service development. We are constantly considering new ideas; this is an interesting subset.

## Tilt Cloud
[Tilt Cloud](https://docs.tilt.dev/sign_in_tilt_cloud.html) is the integrated companion experience to Tilt, empowering software developers to better collaborate in teams, and help developer experience (DX) owners manage consistent and elevated DX experiences across a software organization. Tilt Cloud solves problems in three broad categories: Release, support, and measure.

### Release
Ensure folks are using the right version of Tilt.
- [Team owner promotes current Tilt version for team](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt/issues/3125)

### Support (each other)
Ensure developers are effectively collaborating on code.
- [Private team cloud snapshots](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt/issues/3128)

### Measure
Understand how developers are doing development, surfacing inefficiencies, in order to equip DX owners and teams to continuously improve DX.

## Tilt for Windows
We aim to support Tilt for all popular development platforms. Tilt is [currently available for macOS and Linux](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html). Windows support is in alpha, but we plan to support it fully.

## Extensions
We are working Tilt Extensions, a mechanism to package custom functions so that you can re-use them in your Tiltfile. The functions are meant to be open sourced, to foster sharing ideas within the Tilt community, and encouraging best practices.
