The continuously changing general product direction of Tilt and Tilt Cloud is based on conversations with existing and potential users, and our current thinking of multi-service development. We are constantly considering new ideas; this is an interesting subset.

## Tilt Cloud
Tilt Cloud is the integrated companion experience to Tilt, empowering software developers to better collaborate in teams, and help developer experience (DX) owners manage consistent and elevated DX experiences across a software organization. Tilt Cloud solves problems in three broad categories: Release, support, and measure.

### Release
Ensure folks are using the right version of Tilt.
- [Team owner promotes current Tilt version for team](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt/issues/3125)

### Support (each other)
Ensure developers are effectively collaborating on code.
- [Private team cloud snapshots](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt/issues/3128)

### Measure
Understand how developers are doing development, surfacing inefficiencies, in order to equip DX owners and teams to continuously improve DX.

## Tilt for Windows
We aim to support Tilt for all popular development platforms. Tilt is [currently available for macOS and Linux](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html). Windows support is in alpha, but we plan to support it fully.

## Extensions
We are working Tilt Extensions, a mechanism to package custom functions so that you can re-use them in your Tiltfile. The functions are meant to be open sourced, to foster sharing ideas within the Tilt community, and encouraging best practices.
