### Our First Product

Tilt relieves the pains of local Kubernetes microservice development. It already
automates and optimizes container image builds, and has a Heads-Up Display UI
that saves you from having to play 20 questions with kubectl. But which pains do
we relieve next? What features relieve them fastest or best?

We need a Frontend Engineer to help build prototypes and features to answer that question.

### What You'll Do

- Write React components in Typescript

- Design and evolve component libraries that help us iterate on product quickly

- Build user interfaces that help engineers work with their local Kubernetes dev environment

- Attend to our UI performance, accessibility, responsiveness, and compatibility to reach more users

- Talk to external teams about the pain points of local Kubernetes dev. What new
  information could they see to get them unstuck? Which new affordances would
  they need to be more productive?

- Prototype cloud-native dev features that we haven’t even thought of yet. How
  can we make your data available to your team, and make your team’s data
  available to you?

- Help us build a team culture where everyone's doing their best work

### Ideal, but not Required

- Lives in New York City, or would be willing to relocate.
  <br>(It would be hard to be the first remote engineer, but it might work if you had previous remote experience)

- Familiar with Docker, containers, microservices, and Kubernetes. Can explain what problems they solve.
  <br>(We can teach you these tools to you if we need to, but it would be a shame to learn them only to find out that you hate them.)

- Experience with Go
  <br>(Without at least some Go experience or a willingness to learn, you might have a hard time prototyping new features.)

### Interested? Apply.
Even if you don't have experience or interest in every bullet, we want to hear from you. There's no perfect candidate, and we want to find the right fit, even if it's different than we imagine. We especially would like to meet underrepresented/underestimated candidates.
