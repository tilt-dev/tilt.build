### Interested? Apply.

Even if you don't have experience or interest in every bullet, we want to hear
from you. There's no perfect candidate, and we want to find the right fit, even
if it's different than we imagine. We especially would like to meet
underrepresented/underestimated candidates.

About half our team is in NYC and working from home during the pandemic. About half is remote, each in a different city. We believe you can be successful in this role remotely.

Must be authorized to work in the US, and able to work at least 5 hours overlap
with US Eastern time.
