### Our Mission

Tilt Dev is building the platform for multi-service software
development. Imagine if every time you hit save, you could kick off workflows
that run in the cloud, with results that are accessible across your team
instantly and historically. How much more productive could you be? What
dev collaboration tools have we not even thought of yet?

### About Us

{% assign total = site.data.people | where: "active","true" | size %}
This is a big mission, and we're a small team ({{total}} people, based in NYC's Union Square).

We're software engineers and toolsmiths. We've built developer tools and
consumer products. Nick and Dan (founders) met working at Google on projects
like Google Sheets, Google Code, and others. We think cloud-native products like
GitHub and Google Sheets are great because of the new workflows they
enable. We're excited to be working towards it.

We want to be a better company in an industry that's been neither diverse nor
inclusive. Each month, we give $100/employee to an org that's making tech less
toxic. We recognize "meritocracy" and "work hard, play hard" as culture smells.
