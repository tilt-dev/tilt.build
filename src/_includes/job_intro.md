### Our Mission

Modern apps are made up of tons of services. 

Developers need a standardized environment to ensure all those services behave.

Tilt Dev is a dev enviroment as code that allows teams to define how and where
those services run. Tilt gives developers a single service manager that keeps
the services up to date with local changes, whether they're running on a
personal laptop or on a remote cloud cluster, whether they're built from source
or centrally managed.

We believe that turnkey cloud-connected dev environments will unlock new
platforms and new ways for engineers to collaborate that they can't even imagine
today.

### About Us

{% assign total = site.data.people | where: "active","true" | size %}
This is a big mission, and we're a small team ({{total}} people, based in NYC's Union Square).

We're software engineers and toolsmiths. We've built developer tools and
consumer products. Nick and Dan (founders) met working at Google on projects
like Google Sheets, Google Code, and others. We think cloud-native products like
GitHub and Google Sheets are great because of the new workflows they
enable. We're excited to be working towards it.

We want to be a better company in an industry that's been neither diverse nor
inclusive. [Each month, we give $100/employee to an org that's making tech less
toxic.](https://github.com/tilt-dev/company/tree/master/donations) We recognize 
"meritocracy" and "work hard, play hard" as culture smells.
