### Our First Product

Tilt relieves the pains of local Kubernetes microservice development. It already
automates and optimizes container image builds, and has a Heads-Up Display UI
that saves you from having to play 20 questions with kubectl. But which pains do
we relieve next? What features relieve them fastest or best?

We need a Developer Tools Engineer to help build features to answer those questions.

### What You'll Do

- Write Go code that interoperates with the Kubernetes API.

- Build tooling to help engineers build container images,
  update their local Kubernetes dev environment, and diagnose problems.

- Pair with users on how to set up their environment with Tilt,
  ranging from old ecosystems (e.g. pre-container Java JARs)
  to new ones (e.g. functions as a service managed by CRDs).

- Talk to external DevOps teams about the pain points of local Kubernetes dev.
  What new information could they see to get them unstuck?
  How do they diagnose a cluster, deployment, or service that’s misbehaving?

- Architect cloud-native dev features that we haven’t even thought of yet.
  How can we make your data available to your team,
  and make your team’s data available to you?

- Help us build a team culture where everyone's doing their best work.

### Ideal, but not Required

- Has developed and deployed a multi-service application on Kubernetes.
  Familiar with common design patterns for managing microservices.
  <br>(The Kubernetes pattern of declarative infrastructure takes some time
  to get used to if you haven’t seen it before.)

- Experience with Typescript and CSS
  <br>(Though we expect you're more comfortable on the backend,
  features will need a UI in our typescript/CSS frontend.)
