### The Challenge

To dramatically improve multi-service dev, we need teams to change their familiar workflow and take a chance on a new one. That’s asking a lot.

To build that trust, we need an informed perspective about what's most critical to know, when. Tilt needs to meet the needs of different kinds of engineers — DevOps, Frontend, Backend, Data, and more. Then encourage them to share their expertise and help one another.

That’s where design comes in. Our product includes an installed local binary and a SaaS platform. Tilt Local drives iteration and surfaces errors while you code. Tilt Cloud helps a team share data from local instances and troubleshoot errors together. How does each surface communicate its role and how they connect?

### What You'll Do

- Conduct user research within our active open-source community as well as partner teams. Understand their frustrations and motivations to better address the pains of multi-service dev.

- Design thoughtful UX to present the right insights at the right time. What alerts should interrupt them? What new interfaces can help them diagnose problems when things go wrong?

- Deliver visual artifacts, including mocks and interaction flows, to help the engineering team implement features.
- Evaluating our hunches using tools like analytics, A/B tests, and prototypes to ensure we're meeting customer needs. Support design-led product development.

- Help us build a team culture where everyone's doing their best work.

### Who You’ll Work With

We’re a small team where you’ll get to know everyone as you solve problems together. In particular:

- [Han Yu](https://twitter.com/hanacious) does a hybrid of UX/UI design and frontend engineering. You’ll work closely with them to design features and processes, so a strong design sense makes Tilt stand out among dev tools.

- [L Korbes](https://twitter.com/ellenkorbes) does developer relations. You’ll work with them to explain and demo how dev teams can fit Tilt into their work.

- [Victor Wu](https://twitter.com/victorwuky) is our head of product. The potential surface area of Tilt is too huge to tackle all at once. He’ll empower you to figure out priorities and focus. 

### Ideal, But Not Required

- Experience with both web-based and terminal-based user interfaces<br>
  (Designing for both has unique challenges.)

- Ability to write HTML, CSS, and JS/React<br>
  (We have a lot of respect for product design as a skill independent of UI engineering! But we want to be up-front that roles can be fluid at a startup.)

- Familiar with Docker, containers, microservices, and Kubernetes. Can explain what problems they solve for developers<br>
  (We can teach you how engineers use these tools if we need to, but it would be a shame to learn them only to find out that you hate them.)
