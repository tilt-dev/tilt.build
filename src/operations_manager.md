### The Role

Tilt is looking for an Operations Manager to make sure all the planes are
landing on schedule on our criss-crossing Product, DevRel, and Engineering
efforts.

This role is perfect for someone who cares about developer experience, but who
wants to dabble in the non-engineering work of releasing dev infrastructure for
humans. It’s for someone who is well-organized, but who thrives in chaos.

### What You'll Do

The operations manager will have a broad range of responsibilities. They will
support the logistical needs of a startup team in an environment that changes
quickly. They will tackle new problems regularly.

Here are some examples of projects you might work on:

- Keeping tabs on all the moving pieces of a major launch or website re-brand,
  including working with an external marketer and designer and in-house developer
  relations.

- Coordinating with partner engineering teams, organizing meetings,
  and pulling in engineers to talk to users. (We regularly work with partner teams
  to get feedback on upcoming features and integrate with other tools.)

- Scheduling user interviews and tracking how user research feeds into overall product strategy.

- Working with our head of product to determine what qualitative signals and
  quantitative metrics we need to track, and how to operationalize collection.

More abstractly, your goals will be to:

- Ensure the team stays organized and on top of multiple initiatives at once.

- Implement internal communications and processes so that information gets to
  people without them being overwhelmed with distraction.

- Help us build a team culture where everyone's doing their best work

### Ideal, But Not Required

- Prior operations experience at a startup.<br/>

  (We think this would not be a good fit for someone who expects a lot of
  regularity or structure in their work.)

- Strategic-level understanding of Docker, containers, microservices, and
  Kubernetes. Can explain what problems they solve and why teams adopt them.<br/>

  (This is not a technical role, but we don’t want you to feel disconnected or
  lost or bored.)

### Interested? Apply.

Even if you don't have experience or interest in every bullet, we want to hear
from you. There's no perfect candidate, and we want to find the right fit, even
if it's different than we imagine. We especially would like to meet
underrepresented/underestimated candidates.

About half our team is in NYC and working from home during the pandemic. About
half is remote, each in a different city. We believe you can be successful in
this role remotely.

Must be authorized to work in the US, ideally on US Eastern Time (to work with
our coworkers in Europe).
