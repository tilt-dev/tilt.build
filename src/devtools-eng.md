### Our First Product

Tilt relieves the pains of local Kubernetes microservice development. It already
automates and optimizes container image builds, and has a Heads-Up Display UI
that saves you from having to play 20 questions with kubectl. But which pains do
we relieve next? What features relieve them fastest or best?

We need a Devtools Engineer to help build features to answer those questions.

### What You'll Do

- Write Go code that interoperates with the Kubernetes API.

- Build tooling to help engineers build container images,
  update their local Kubernetes dev environment, and diagnose problems.

- Pair with users on how to set up their environment with Tilt,
  ranging from old ecosystems (e.g. pre-container Java JARs)
  to new ones (e.g. functions as a service managed by CRDs).

- Talk to external DevOps teams about the pain points of local Kubernetes dev.
  What new information could they see to get them unstuck?
  How do they diagnose a cluster, deployment, or service that’s misbehaving?

- Architect cloud-native dev features that we haven’t even thought of yet.
  How can we make your data available to your team,
  and make your team’s data available to you?

- Help us build a team culture where everyone's doing their best work.

### Ideal, but not Required

- Lives in New York City, or would be willing to relocate.
  <br>(It would be hard to be the first remote engineer, but it might
  work if you had previous remote experience.)

- Has developed and deployed a multi-service application on Kubernetes.
  Familiar with common design patterns for managing microservices.
  <br>(The Kubernetes pattern of declarative infrastructure takes some time
  to get used to if you haven’t seen it before.)

- Experience with Typescript and CSS
  <br>(Though we expect you're more comfortable on the backend,
  features will need a UI in our typescript/CSS frontend.)


### Interested? Apply.

Even if you don't have experience or interest in every bullet, we want to hear from you. There's no perfect candidate, and we want to find the right fit, even if it's different than we imagine. We especially would like to meet
underrepresented/underestimated candidates.
